This project was created as part of my learning journey in web application testing. It includes automated tests for various functionalities of an e-commerce website. Currently, the project is still a work in progress, and the checkout tests are yet to be completed. The goal is to ensure a thorough testing process, focusing on critical components such as login, product addition to cart, and user interactions."
